[x] Proper UTF-8
[] Show the current (opened) filename
[] Move current line up/down with (Alt-{uparrow}, Alt-{downarrow})
[] CRLF line ends? Convert all CRLF to \n. We should do an option for the what we expect of program to do, like convert all of the \n to CRLF
[] Draw spaces
[] Parse tab characters "\t" (replace them with 4 spaces) when loading a file
[] Open a file
[] Save the buffer
[] Try to keep the cursor on the same col at the below or above row when we move up or down (just like in vscode)  
[] Smart movement check { } positions, also we should check the current language
[] Add a little padding and scrolling offset
[] Draw right, bottom scrollbar
[] Word stepping (Ctrl+{arrow})
[] Subword stepping (Alt+{arrow}) 
[] Search forward (Ctrl+?)
[] Search backward (Ctrl+:)
[] Search from the top (Ctrl+F)
[] Search and replace
[] Goto line (Ctrl+G)
[] Range selection
[] Copy / paste
[] Undo / Redo
[] Markers, also do some visualization for them
[] Multiple cursor support
[] File browser
[] Split editor (split screen)
[] Separate input handling like if we open a file browser modal we should not handle editor events like insert text and so on
[] More row_table rebuild proc improvements. Maybe mark the rebuild type like we should do a whole rebuild or a partial rebuild which starting from the last insert character-1
[] Basic syntax highlighting
