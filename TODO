[x] Open a window with a dark green background
[x] Handle key inputs
[x] Display pressed key on the screen
[x] Draw caret
[x] Cursor movement: left, right
[x] Handle backspace (delete the left character)
[x] Handle spacebar
[x] Fix caret X alignment
[x] Fix caret Y alignment (breaks after some line breaks)
[x] Parse \n
[x] Insert spaces when pressing the tab key
[x] Cursor movement: up, down
[x] Fix up/down cursor movement if the above row ends with spaces (is this the actual problem?)
[x] Scale the text properly when resizing the window
[x] Implement screen scrolling
[x] Add a small threshold for screen scrolling
[x] Delete tabs from right
[x] Draw tabulators (4 spaces) (debug)
[x] Display frame debug info on the screen instead of the console
[x] Scroll up or left only if the cursor is at the top or left
[x] Use   WaitMessage() because of the cputime
[x] Fix the first chars problem (its caused by the new rendering thing and the row_table)
[x] Fix the last char problem by adding an extra space ??
[x] PageUp, PageDown
[x] Delete char from left
[x] Delete line
[x] Delete everything from left
[x] Delete whole word from right
[x] Delete subword from right
[x] DeleteWordFromRight - Delete all the whitespace until we find a non-whitespace character
[x] Jump the first character and the last character of current the line
[x] Ctrl-Enter insert line below
[x] Proper UTF-8
[X] Word stepping (Ctrl+{arrow})
[X] Subword stepping (Alt+{arrow})
[X] Custom u8 buffer instead of string builder
[X] Editor context which have multiple buffer, we want multiple editor context for split screen
[] Move cursor related data to the Buffer struct
[X] Need an abstraction for the c_memmove like shift_left or smth
[] An initialization procedure for the new editor instance, because we need to setup and allocate an empty buffer
[] Fix word/subword stepping if the cursor surrounded with multiple line breaks
[] Improve word/subword stepping mainly because the left and right movement not exactly the same
[] Cleanup the keymap.jai. We should rename it something like actions.jai also we should simplify the add_proc thing, also use things for the new beta: - "Added Keymap_Set, which groups multiple Keymaps that can be activated and deactivated depending on what your program is doing ..."
[] Move current line up/down with (Alt-{uparrow}, Alt-{downarrow})
[] Draw spaces. We should remove the current thing because that replaces the spaces with ~ characters which is not gooood!
[] CRLF line ends? Convert all CRLF to \n. We should do an option for the what we expect of program to do, like convert all of the \n to CRLF
[X] Parse tab characters "\t" (replace them with 4 spaces) when loading a file
[X] Open a file
[] Save the buffer (file)
[] Try to keep the cursor on the same col at the below or above row when we move up or down (just like in vscode)
[] Keep the cursor center after new occurence has found
[] Smart movement check { } positions, also we should check the current language
[] Add a little padding and scrolling offset
[] Draw right, bottom scrollbar
[] Search forward (Ctrl+?)
[] Search backward (Ctrl+:)
[] Search from the top (Ctrl+F)
[] Search and replace
[] Goto line (Ctrl+G)
[] Range selection
[] Copy / paste
[] Undo / Redo
[] Markers, also do some visualization for them
[] Multiple cursor support
[] File browser
[] Split editor (split screen)
[] Separate input handling like if we open a file browser modal we should not handle editor events like insert text and so on
[] More row_table rebuild proc improvements. Maybe mark the rebuild type like we should do a whole rebuild or a partial rebuild which starting from the last insert character-1
[] Basic syntax highlighting
[] Draw the left line which indicates the block from { to } (this option should be toggable)

/* IDEAS */

/* PHP */
phpstan integration
show errors besides the corresponding rows (maybe cols too)
show the var types by pressing a key (can we use phpstan for this?)
