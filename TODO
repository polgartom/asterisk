- Bug! Handle remote directories that contain only files. E.g., if I specify the workdir like -workdir \\server.local\var\www, and www contains only files, it will crash.
- File watcher
- Update the cursor position in the other editor panel if the same file is open in both. For example, if we insert text in the left editor, the right editorâ€™s cursor would appear to move backward because its position stays the same while the content grows.
- Restore the editor's cursor position after buffer switch related to that buffer.
- Directory watcher? It takes some time to open the file browser if we on the shared network directory.
- Add commands like "to_snake_case" or "to_upper_case"... and a command selection widget
- Alert if we want to close the window or a buffer that is unsaved. The dialog should contain a "save" and "save all" buttons.

[Config]
    - Which file extensions and directories are included, excluded
    - Specific keybindings for commands and so on...
